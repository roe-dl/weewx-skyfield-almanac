# Language files

## What are those files for?

Those language files are used to augment the language files of the 
installed skins during the installation of this extension. 

## How to add a localization for your local language?

To add another language get the file `template.conf`, copy it to a
file named after the language code of your choosen language,  and add the
names in that language at the right side of the equal signs.
In case there is no local name for some entry, remove the line
of that entry entirely.
